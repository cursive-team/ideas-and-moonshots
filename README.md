# ideas-and-moonshots
An active, public list of project ideas related to NFCxZK. We are aiming to get more visibility and activity around the intersection of NFC and ZK technologies. Please reach to hello@jubmoji.quest with any interest or join the PSE discord!

## Specific use cases

- ID/contact cards
  - More integration with payment/social
- Loyalty programs
- Mailable starter pack / care package
  - Set of signature-enabeld cards
  - Instructions for how to distribute and use
- Parterning with city tourism
  - Map of activities
  - Tap into a bunch of different places
  - Rewards for engaging with community
  - Interoperable signatures
  - Cities don't need to agree on same data layer to build interoperable / pokedex style connections
- Private social graphs
  - Proof of humanity
- Community organizers
  - Creating subgroups in a verifiable and private way
  - Rewarding strong community members
- Social media experience
  - Seeing what you have in common with your friends
  - Snap map with consent
- More granular private stories / photo albums
  - Can have more specific groups to share photos with
  - Can be a feed or a story

## Design explorations
- Different form factors
- Creating a sense of the app being alive when data is private and can only be revealed by ZK proofs

## Technical explorations
- Hardware investigations
  - Improving the speed and efficiency of generating signatures via tap
- Witness encryption to BLS signatures

## Applications of more advanced cryptography
- Private set intersection between collections of signatures
- 2PC to recommend activities for two different people based on what they have done
